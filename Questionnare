To all friends participate in Electrical Engineering, especially Integerated Circuit Design:

Hi~

I want to know if any of you get exhausted about the process of going through many articles and finding the "state-of-arts" you require 
to make comparisons with your own work? I'm trying to make a website to collect the correlated information, such as design parameters 
and citations, to make it easier to find the latest work.

For example, if I want to design a VCO, I can type in the requirements of Oscillation Frequency Phase Noise or other parameters so that 
the webpage can show all circuits that has similar performances in certain order with the citations. Thus, I can pick up the circuits 
that relates to my design and form my "state-of-art" table.

What I want to know is that, do you think this is a good idea and worth to be done and why? Besides, I want to hear some advices about 
the website requirements, such as functions and contents, if you agree with this idea.

Thanks a lot~
